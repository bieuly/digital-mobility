                            To make it in todayâ€™s economy, you have to hustle. Fast-food worker or CEO, Uber driver or student,
                            you have to stay connected in an economy built on the assumption that anyone is always reachable anywhere.
                            In 2017, that means you need a smartphone. 
                            You can apply for jobs via your smartphone, arrange childcare, or trade shifts with your co-workers.
                            For homeless people who use the internet to find beds at shelters or apply for jobs, a smartphone could be a literal lifesaver.
